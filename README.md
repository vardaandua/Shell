# Shell

The above contains a folder having the implementation of a shell which can run the following UNIX commands.
Supported Commands :
1. cd
2. ls
3. help
4. exit
5. history
6. bg
and a lot of other builtin commands.


To run the above folder :
I have used WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Steps to run :
1. using the bash terminal to clone the repository
2. open main.c and run the command in terminal  gcc main.c -o main && "/mnt/c/Users/hp/Desktop/shell/"main
   (here /mnt/c/Users/hp/Desktop/shell/  uses all the files in the folder shell for compilation , you can add path to this folder as in your device).
