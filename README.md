To run the above folder :
I have used WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux)

Steps to run :
1. using the bash terminal to clone the repository
2. open main.c in a code editor and run the command in terminal  gcc main.c -o main && "/mnt/c/Users/hp/Desktop/shell/"main
   (here /mnt/c/Users/hp/Desktop/shell/ is a path to Shell folder and  uses all the files in the folder shell for compilation , you can add path to this folder as in your device) , or You can directly press the run button over the main.c file
